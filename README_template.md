# 🌿 Invisible Garden — ARG25 Projects

Welcome to **Invisible Garden-ARG25**.  
This repository hosts all project submissions for the ARG25 edition.

Each participant (or team) documents their project journey here, updating their progress **weekly** through a single, evolving Pull Request (PR).


## Program Overview

**Duration:** 3 Weeks  
**Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** ends **October 31**
- **Week 2:** ends **November 7**
- **Week 3:** ends **November 14**

Each week, participants update their project README with progress and goals, culminating in a final wrap-up at the end of Week 3.




##  Weekly Progress Workflow

1. **Fork** this repository to your account.
2. Create a branch named after your project:

   `git checkout -b teamname-projectname`

3. Add your folder with the `project-name/`.
- Add a `README.md` using the `README_template.md` provided.
- Optionally create an `assets/` folder for diagrams, screenshots, or code snippets.
4. Commit your README (based on the template) and push to your fork.
5. **Raise a PR** to the main repo and keep updating the same PR each week – update your branch with weekly commits.
