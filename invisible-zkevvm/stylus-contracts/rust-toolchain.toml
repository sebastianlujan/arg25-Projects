# Rust Toolchain Configuration
#
# NOTE: Due to current ruint 1.17.0 compatibility issues, this project
# cannot compile with any stable Rust version. See KNOWN_ISSUES.md.
#
# This file documents the intended toolchain once the upstream issue is resolved.

[toolchain]
# Use nightly until ruint issue is resolved
# Recommended: Switch to stable 1.83+ when available
channel = "nightly"

# Required targets for Stylus WASM compilation
targets = ["wasm32-unknown-unknown"]

# Use rustfmt and clippy for code quality
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]

# Pin to specific date if needed for reproducible builds
# date = "2025-11-11"
