# Rust Toolchain Configuration
#
# NOTE: Due to current ruint 1.17.0 compatibility issues, this project
# cannot compile with any stable Rust version. See KNOWN_ISSUES.md.
#
# This file documents the intended toolchain once the upstream issue is resolved.

[toolchain]
# Trying nightly-2024-12-01: should have edition2024 but before panic breaking change
# nightly-2024-10-01 was too old (no edition2024)
channel = "nightly-2024-12-01"

# Required targets for Stylus WASM compilation
targets = ["wasm32-unknown-unknown"]

# Use rustfmt and clippy for code quality + rust-src for build-std
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy", "rust-src"]
